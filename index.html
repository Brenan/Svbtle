			<h2>How Much of Your Fantasy Football Draft is Predetermined by League Projections?</h2>

				Two weeks ago, we kicked off our fantasy season with a player draft. ESPN’s draft center provides fantasy owners with an overwhelming amount of information on each player, but time and again, only one data point seemed to matter: how many points ESPN projected that player would score. Pick after pick, teams would choose the best available player at each position. By the end of the draft, we were all wondering the same thing: How much do these projections affect draft results?
			</p>
			<p>
				Most leagues follow this pattern, in which fantasy owners tend to adhere to the player rankings provided by the league. While teams rarely select the highest point scorer available - kickers, for instance, tend to get drafted much later than running backs, regardless of their projected output - teams typically follow to point projections by position. In other words, the draft order of wide receivers is nearly identical to the point projection ranking for wide receivers.

			<p>This relationship doesn’t necessarily imply that teams are drafting mechanically according to ESPN’s recommendations. People want to draft the best players, so it makes sense for there to be close relationship between draft orders and the consensus on who’s best. ESPN’s “expert” advice could determine our opinions on players, or it could simply reflect what we already know.
